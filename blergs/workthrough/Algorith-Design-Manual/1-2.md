# Algorithm Design Manual Problem 1-2

## Problem

```
Show that a * b can be less than min(a, b).
```

## Thoughts

- a x b < min(a, b)
  - If a < b : a * b < a
  - If b < a : a * b < b

Case 1: a < b | a != 0
  1. `a * b < a`
  1. `b < a / a`
  1. `b < 1`

Case 2: b < a | b != 0
  1. `a * b < b`
  1. `a < b / b`
  1. `a < 1`

If `a` is negative then `b` can't be without the result being positive and thus larger than either.
If `a` is zero then there is no `b` such that this is possible

# Solution

Both `a` and `b` must be > 0 and < 1.

## Example

```
a <- (.2)
b <- (.4)
minimum <- min(a, b)  // (.2)
result <- (.2) + (.4) // (.08)
result < minimum // Matches condition for completion
```
