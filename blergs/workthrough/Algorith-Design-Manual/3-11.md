# Algorithm Design Manual Problem 3-11

## Problem

```
Suppose that we are given a sequence of n values x_1, x_2, ..., x_n and seek to
quickly answer repeated queries of the form: given i and j, find the smallest value
in x_i,...,x_j.  

  (a) Design a data structure that uses O(n^2) space and answers queries in O(1)
time.  
  (b) Design a data structure that uses O(n) space and answers queries in O(log n)
time. For partial credit, your data structure can use O(n log n) space and have
O(log n) query time.
```

## Overall initial thoughts

`sequence` - An ordered collection of objects.

The given values aren't necessarily in ascending or descending order.

## Initial thoughts

Since time order is constant we can not operate on the entire list (no sorting).
The n^2 space allowance causes a lookup 2D array to pop into my mind (probably a lookup table).

## First pass

``` C#
public class LookupTable {
  private int[][] m_table;
  private uint m_size;

  private bool shouldValueMore(int overrideValue, int nextValue) {
    if (overrideValue < nextValue) {
      // Prefer older value
      return overrideValue;
    }

    return nextValue;
  }

  public LookupTable(int[] values) {
    m_size = values.Length;
    m_table = new int[m_size, m_size];
    for(int i = 0; i < m_size; i++) {
      for(int j = i; j < m_size; i++) {
        int max = values[i];
        for(int current = i + 1; current < j; current++) {
          if (shouldValueMore(max, values[current])) {
            max = values[current];
          }
        }
        m_table[i][j] = max;
      }
    }
  }

  public int Lookup(uint i, uint j) {
    if (i > m_size - 1 || j > m_size -1) {
      throw new InvalidInputException("Invalid size: (" + i + "," + j + ")");
    }
    if (j < i) {
      throw new InvalidInputException("Upper point cannot be smaller than lower bound");
    }

    return m_table[i][j];
  }
}
```

## Compiler errors

1. Failed to use the correct return for `shouldValueMore`. Mixed the assignment usage and boolean usage in my head.
  - Changed to return the next value and just assign it to max
1. Using `uint` instead of just sticking with `int` for length storage. My knowledge of `uint` in C# is limited.
  - Changed to int and added lower-bound checks
1. Didn't realize there was a difference between T[][] and T[,]
  - Changed the access method to use C# 2D

## Typos

1. Used `i` in `j` loop for increment
1. Renamed max to min (we want minimum)

## Tests

1. Single range usage
1. Full range usage (max)
1. Negative numbers
1. Mixed numbers
1. Edge tests (first, last)
  - Found bug with last item not being accounted for. Changed inner loop to use `<= j`.

## Analysis

### Space

- `O(n^2)` - 1 - N x N 2D Array
- `O(1)` - Constant value

- Total: `O(n^2)`

### Operation

- `O(1)` Lookup

### Pre-Processing

- `O(n^2)` - Iteration through values twice.
  - Outer loop all `n` values. Inner loop 1 is `i` to `n`. Inner loop 2 is `0` to `i`.
  - All other operations are O(1)
